Hi, I am Tobias. I am a PhD researcher at the School of Business and Economics at Humboldt-University of Berlin. I work as a research assistant at the Institute of Accounting and Auditing, Chair of Joachim Gassen. I started my PhD in 2017. Before that, I worked as a lecturer at Beuth University and consultant at the German statutory pension insurance scheme.

My research focuses on determinants of transparency and interactions of financial market participants and its impact on transparency. I am especially interested in firm-government interactions and how they influence the output and transparency of both firms and governments.
